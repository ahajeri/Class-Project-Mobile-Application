# Cross Platform Application of new Grad Students

## Purpose

There is a notable lack of resources available for new graduate student coming to the USA from another country. Every year new graduate student create Facebook/whatsapp group to connect with their prospective batch mates and senior graduate student to discuss and plan their travel and accommodation.

## Introduction

Designed a mobile application that will enable new students to get connected with their batch mates and senior student. Will also enable the user to find roommates, book temporary on­campus/off­campus accommodation and book taxi/get a free ride from the airport. By connecting each other they can also share their travel details such as flight cost, travel date, source and destination with each other (who are traveling from the same source and destination).
